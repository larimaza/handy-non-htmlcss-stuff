This is for Windows users - Mac has a much simpler way to do this, as usual. :p
So, as you probably don't want your web files to have any spaces or weird characters in their names, this might come in handy:

1. Select all files and rename the first with the title you want and the number between parenthesis starting with a '1', so that you'll always have the same number of digits. 
For example: img(101).jpg
The rest will be renamed img(102).jpg, img(103).jpg, etc.

2. Hold SHIFT and right click in the open area of the File Explorer, then choose "Open command window here". Issue the following command:
ren *.* img_???.*

All done! Your files will then be renamed to img_101.jpg, img_102.jpg, etc.
